<h1>About Me!</h1>

Hi!ðŸ‘‹ I'm <strong>Manolo</strong>. I am a high school student trying to learn how to code on the side.

ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning <strong>HTML</strong> and am trying to become a fullstack developer by <em>the end</em> of the school year.

To all the new coders that read this as well, I would love to talk with you and learn as we go along.
